# UnsplashWallpaper
A program that sets your wallpaper to an image from unsplash.com

Use config.json to configure the program.

<<<<<<< HEAD
It has configs for:
* Image Width
* Image Height
* Featured Posts
* Photos posted today/this week
* Categories
* Search Terms
And I will be implementing a system to change the style of wallpaper. Ex: Tile, Stretch, Fill, etc.
